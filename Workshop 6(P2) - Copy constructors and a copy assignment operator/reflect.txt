Workshop 06 has made me learn to deal with copy constructors and a copy assignment operator as well. I faced a little issue while dealing with allocating a dynamic memory in copy constructor where I was allocating the dynamic memory for storing the new copied variables, outside my if statement which was causing a memory leak. On running the submission on matrix, it was showing a memory leak and I was not able to figure out how to deal with that, I thought the problem was with setEmpty() function, but it was the dynamic memory allocation problem. Moreover, I faced an issue in displaying the output where the solution to that error was writing "fixed" in the os command.Anyway, the outputs finally matched after solving all the errors and it gave me a vivid knowledge about copy constructors.
