Workshop 4 has taught me how to deal with constructors and destructors in C++. Setting all the inputs to null, creating dynamic memory in the constructor, deleting the dynamic memory in destructor and setting it to null again to prevent memory leak are some of the methods/topics I have learnt in this workshop. This workshop, to be honest, was more straightforward than the rest of the workshops as all the things were very simple to implement. I didn't face any major issues while coding this code except a small error. I didn't check if the bots were valid while printing the number of bots who had battery percentage less than 30, so instead of 2 robots, my code was printing 4 robots which then I changed the IF conditon, adding the isValid() fucntion in it which produced the correct output. Hence, this workshop has thoroughly understood me the concept of constructors and destructors.
