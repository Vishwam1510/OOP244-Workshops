Workshop 10 has taught me how to deal with template functions, in the beginning it seemed easy to me as we just had to deal with the template function module as well as the main module which sounds pretty easy but then there were some difficulties faced by me. I was confused in making the find function which led to many small errors once I created the function. Later going through the notes I found out the loophole where I was getting my program wrong. I was not including a fucntion of template which was leading to errors. Later, it ran and compiled successfully. Hence, it gave me a brief knowledge about template functions. Talking about the recent milestone, I started the final milestone which is milestone 5 and am halfway of it, it seems easy at the moment as it includes topics from past, whereas I recently submitted milestone 4 which was delayed by me as I faced errors in that too which took time to get a proper solution. All in all, workshops and project are giving me a good knowledge about all the topics in OOP.
