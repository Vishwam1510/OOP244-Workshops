Workshop 08 has taught me the way to deal with the pure virtual class as well as coding an abstract base class. Dealing with all the properties with pure virtual functions was all this workshop what about. Following the instructions given for the workshop made me do the workshop with ease, without having any problems. Moreover, recently I did milestone 2 which involved dealing with the library app module where I dealt with the run method which was the main application driver. Milestone 2 was a little tough than the first milestone yet it was doable. Hence, doing workshops and milestones is giving me a great knowledge of many things among which pure virtual function was the latest topic covered. To keep it in a nutshell, the upcoming milestones and workshops will cover some new topics whereas the past workshops and milestones have covered many things for the language c++.
