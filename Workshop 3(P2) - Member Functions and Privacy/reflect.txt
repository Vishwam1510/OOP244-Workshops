In workshop 3, I learnt many new things which includes member functions and privacy.I understood the mechanism of how one can set members as private members which cannot be accessed by any other external object as well as setting public functions which can be accessed by anyone. The lessons from past two workshops are still helping in this workshop and are useful to have a knowledge of. Although I faced an issue solving the draw() function where I was doing an infinite loop by mistake, yet after trial and errors I solved my issue. This workshop gave me a good experience on how to work with member functions.
