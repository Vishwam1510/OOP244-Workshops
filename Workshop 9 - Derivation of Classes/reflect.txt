Workshop 09 has helped me study deep about deriving a class as learnt from previous workshops, also taught how to override virtual an non-virtual methods of the base class. It consisted the work that required the knowdlege of dealing with dynamic data which we have learned in the whole semester. Constructors, destructors , type conversion , displaying, reading and writing were some of the few functions which we dealt in Workshop 09, and have been doing in many of the previous workshops. Talking about the recent milestone, I am dealing with milestone 4 right now which continues with the Library module as well as the Date module, adding a one more class in milestone 4 which is Book class where we have to deal with the rule of three, as well as read, write and type functions. Talking about previous milestone, milestone 3 was bit tough for me as I was confused in the publications module which dealt an error where the date was printing as 70 instead of 07 which dealt in very late submission of my milestone 3 as I found the solution after very long time.
